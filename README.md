<strong>The Odin Project - Foundations - HTML Foundations - Basic Recipe Website</strong>

<p>The goal of this project is to build on and cement my HTML skills and knowledge that I have gained while working through The Odin Project.</p>
<p>I will be building a simple recipe website that will have an index page that will contain links to a few recipes.</p>

<strong>After completing this project, I have accomplished:</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>Properly setting up and organizing HTML files</li>
    <li>Linking HTML files together</li>
    <li>Input images with use of the alternative text attribute</li>
    <li>Created ordered and unordered lists for the recipe instructions</li>
    <li>Added in cooking notes using the emphasis tag</li>
    <li>Added a Home/main page button on recipes sites to return to the index page</li>
    <li>Used body and paragraph elements to describe the recipe</li>
    <li>Linked a CSS stylesheet to the HTML files for future work</li>
    </ul>

<strong>The Odin Project - Foundations - HTML Foundations - Basic Recipe Website</strong>

<p>The goal of this project is to build on and cement my HTML skills and knowledge that I have gained while working through The Odin Project.</p>
<p>I will be building a simple recipe website, using only HTML, that will have an index page that will contain links to a few recipes.</p>

<strong>After completing this project, I will have accomplished:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Version control using Git and GitHub</li>
    <li>Properly setting up and organizing HTML files</li>
    <li>HTML coding best practices</li>
    <li>Linking HTML files together</li>
    <li>Adding images with use of the alternative text attribute</li>
    <li>Creating ordered and unordered lists for the recipe instructions</li>
    <li>Using multiple HTML tags and elements to best organize and describe the recipes</li>
    <li>Linked a CSS stylesheet to the HTML files for future work</li>
    <li>Linked a JS script to the HTML files for future work</li>
</ul>

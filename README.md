The Odin Project - Foundations - HTML Foundations - Basic Recipe Website

The goal of this project is to build on and cement my HTML skills and knowledge that I have gained while working through The Odin Project.
I will be building a simple recipe website that will have an index page that will contain links to a few recipes.

    Linking HTML files together
    Inputed images with alternative text
    Created ordered and unordered lists for the steps and recipes
    Added in cooking notes by emphasizing them at bottom of the page
    Added a Home/main page button on recipes sites to go back to starting page
    used body and paragraph elements to describe what the recipe is all about
    Linked a CSS stylesheet to the HTML files
    Properly implemented various types of CSS selectors and inheritance, keeping in mind of specificity rules.

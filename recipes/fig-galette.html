    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul><em>For Dough:</em>
        <li>1 ½ cups all purpose flour (213 grams), plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>10 tbsp cold butter (142 grams), cut into cubes</li>
        <li>4 tbsp ice cold water</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk, for brushing crust</li>
    </ul>
    <ul><em>For Filling:</em>
        <li>1 pint fresh figs, stems off and quartered</li>
        <li>½ cup or so of peach marmalade</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1-2 slices of prosciutto</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons crumbled goat cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><em>For Dough:</em>
        <li>Use a food processor, add the flour and salt, give a couple pulses to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the cold butter cubes and pulse again a few times until you get small clumps.</li>
        <li>Have the ice cold water ready, turn on the food processor then add one tablespoon of water at a time.</li>
        <li>Let it continue to run until it forms a ball of dough, if not, add another tablespoon of water until it does. Turn off the machine and transfer the ball of dough to a lightly clean work surface that’s lightly dust with flour. Form dough into a thick patty or disk-like shape. Cover in plastic wrap, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to two days.</li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the fridge 10 minutes before you will roll it out. It is important the dough stays cold. So make sure when you are ready to assemble and bake, the oven is already preheated.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol><em>After Dough is Made:</em>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, set aside. Take the dough out 10 minutes before you are ready to assemble then transfer to the oven.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough using a rolling pin, on a lightly floured surface. Make sure it’s rolled out into an even layer, not too thin where it can tear, in circle shape with about a 12 inch diameter. It’s okay if it’s not a perfect circle, they are meant to look rustic.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the dough to the center of the baking sheet. Spread the peach marmalade onto the center of the dough, then spread to the edges, making sure to keep about a 2 inch border away from the edge. Begin to place all the quartered pieces of fig over the marmalade.</li>
        <li>Then begin to fold sides of the dough over the filling, creating a border crust, it will overlap as you go around the circle.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg yolk, then brush onto the crust. Sprinkle with the fresh rosemary.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes, or until the crust is nice and golden and the filling is gently bubbling.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for about 10-15 minutes. Top with pieces of prosciutto and goat cheese crumbles. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

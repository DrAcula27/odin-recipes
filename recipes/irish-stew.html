    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>Irish stew is a common dish of Ireland that consists of lamb and locally grown root vegetables like potatoes, onions, and sometimes carrots. Everyone, regardless of their heritage, appreciates a good beef stew. Stew in general is always comforting and the perfect meal for those cold, winter nights. My Instant Pot version of Irish stew wouldn’t be considered authentic because I added in some extra, nontraditional ingredients, but it sure is packed with some outstanding flavors. If you want to leave out the stout beer, you totally can, just substitute with some extra beef broth.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ lb. lamb, cut into 2 inch cubes (or stew meat)</li>
        <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 russet potatoes (or 4 yukon gold), peeled and cut into cubes</li>
        <li>3 large carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>3 stalks of celery, sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4-6 tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 bottle (14/16 oz) dark stout, Guiness</li>
        <li>2-3 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2-3 sprigs of fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoon Worcheshire sauce</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 quart of beef broth (4 cups)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ cup peas</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch or flour + ¼ cup water, stirred together</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season meat with salt, pepper and dried herbs. Toss to coat all over then set aside. Wrap the sprigs of thyme and rosemary together using an extra spring to wrap and tie a knot, set aside.</li>
        <li>Using a 6 quart Instant Pot, turn on the saute mode. Heat olive oil then once hot add the meat. Brown on all sides but do not cook all the way through. Just enough to brown all over. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pieces of meat to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, add onions and garlic to the pot, sprinkle with salt and saute until tender for about a minute or two. Add the tomato paste and stout to deglaze the pot. Cook for about 1 minute, until the mixture is well combined.</li>
        <li>Add carrots, celery, potatoes, meat, Worcheshire, and bay leaf to the pot, stir to combine then add the bunch of tied fresh herbs on top.</li>
        <li>Press cancel on the Instant Pot, then turn on the pressure cooking mode. Pressure cook on high for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>When pressure cooking is complete, let it naturally release the pressure on its own, about 30 minutes. Remove the lid and turn on saute mode. Discard the bunch of herbs then add peas and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the cornstarch and water in a small mixing bowl, then add to the stew. This will thicken the stew. Saute for a few minutes until the peas are tender and the stew has thickened.</li>
    </ol>
